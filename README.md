### Pac-Man Advanced
###### Re-imagining of classic Pac-Man as a cross-platform C++ project

This is a personal C++ implementation of Pac-Man, developed for educational/research purposes.
The source is freely available "as-is", in the hope that it will be used as an educational reference.
As a programming challenge, it includes custom features (e.g. cross-platform support) and is not a
mere port of the original arcade game. Several elements are preserved from official games as a
celebration of Pac-Man's history.
